**Conclusion:**
The simulation of ball impact on the plate at two distinct velocities, 10 m/s and 20 m/s, has provided valuable insights into the structural behavior of the system. The comprehensive analysis of the results reveals significant findings that contribute to a deeper understanding of the plate's response to dynamic loading.

At the lower velocity of 10 m/s, the plate exhibited a certain level of deformation and stress distribution, showcasing the material's ability to absorb and dissipate energy. As the impact velocity increased to 20 m/s, the structural response intensified, with more pronounced deformations and localized stress concentrations.

The friction coefficient of 0.2 between the ball and the plate played a crucial role in the interaction dynamics. It influenced the contact forces and the distribution of stresses, impacting the overall structural integrity during the collision.

The simulation results have highlighted critical parameters such as maximum stress points, displacement patterns, and contact forces. These insights can inform design considerations, helping engineers optimize structures for impact resistance and mitigate potential failure modes.
