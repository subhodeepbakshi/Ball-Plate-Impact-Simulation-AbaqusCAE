# Ball-Plate-Impact-Simulation-AbaqusCAE
Explored the dynamic impact behavior of a ball on a plate using Abaqus CAE simulation. This repository contains the setup, materials, and analysis for impact velocities of 10m/s and 20m/s. Gained insights into structural responses, deformation patterns, and contact forces for robust design considerations.
